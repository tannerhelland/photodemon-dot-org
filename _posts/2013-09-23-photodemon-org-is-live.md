For the past year, all PhotoDemon updates have been posted on [my personal blog](http://www.tannerhelland.com/).  This worked well enough when PD was just a small project, but as its popularity has grown, it has made less and less sense for it to live on a small subsection of some random dude's website.

Over the past few weeks I have been working on a new home for PD, and today, that new home goes live!  [PhotoDemon.org](http://photodemon.org) will now host all downloads, updates, and help documentation related to PD.  Between now and when version 6.0 launches (hopefully by the end of the month), I'll work on moving all relevant PhotoDemon content to this site.

I will also be updating PD's source code to reflect the change.  As of 6.0's release, all update checks will be processed through the new site.  

In the meantime, make sure to [download the 6.0 beta](2013/09/19/photodemon-6-0-beta-is-live).  I think you'll like it.
