## Overview

I am _so excited_ to finally write this article.

After 2.5 years of work, 1,500+ code commits, and 3,000+ builds, PhotoDemon 7.0 is nearly ready for release. To give an idea of how much has changed, this release includes more new features and improvements than **the past four releases combined**. 7.0 represents a monumental effort, and it would not be possible without all the amazing people who have donated money, time, and feedback.

**Thank you to everyone who donates!** Your support means the world to me.

I originally wrote this release announcement as a single article, but it was so massive that it crashed some web browsers.  So instead, I've now separated various features into their own articles, all of which are linked below.  

Without further ado, here is what's new in PhotoDemon 7.0.

  * [All-new user interface, including theme support](2017/11/07/photodemon-7-0-final-ui-update)
  * [Advanced text tools](2015/08/03/coming-soon-best-in-class-text-tools)
  * [On-canvas paint tools](2017/11/07/photodemon-7-0-paint-tools)
  * [New adjustments and effects](2017/11/07/photodemon-7-0-new-adjustments-and-effects)
  * [Full Unicode support](2017/11/07/photodemon-7-0-unicode-support/)
  * [Core engine improvements](2017/11/07/photodemon-7-0-core-engine-improvements)
  * [Other miscellaneous improvements](2017/11/07/photodemon-7-0-miscellaneous-improvements)

## Known bugs

Some language files are still being tidied up, but other than that, I am not aware of any outstanding bugs.  If you run into anything unexpected, please [let me know](about/contact/) so I can fix it before release!

## Special thanks

The articles above include a number of special thanks to individuals who helped make this release possible, but I'd like to add a few more if I can:

**Thank you** to vhreal1302, Boban Gjerasimoski, Roy K, Davor Å ikic, Chen Lin, and Zhu JY for their help with this release.  These individuals helped me track down many obnoxious bugs and issues, and this release would have taken even longer without their help.

Thank you as well to the many other people who contributed bug reports, feature ideas, and feedback, whether big or small.  

## When will the official 7.0 release be?

I honestly don't know.  If I don't get any serious bug reports over the next few days, I may go ahead and release 7.0 this weekend.  Serious bugs may require a longer beta test.  It all depends on the feedback I receive.

Thank you in advance to anyone who can help test the beta.  I obviously want this release to be as bug-free as possible, and the more who can test it, the better the final release will be!
