After each new release, a few weeks go by without nightly builds because there isn't enough new code to warrant user testing.  But that ends today for version 6.0, because 6.2 nightly builds are now available!  Grab them from [the download page](download/), or if you want the full accompanying source code, [from GitHub](https://github.com/tannerhelland/PhotoDemon).

As a reminder, please note that official PhotoDemon releases always have even minor version numbers (5.0, 5.4, 6.0, 6.2, etc).  Development builds use odd numbers (e.g. 5.5, 6.1).  The current nightly builds are marked as version 6.1, which will eventually become official version 6.2.

Finally, here are a few things to note about nightly builds:

  * Nightly builds do not contain translations for new features or interface layouts.  They should be tested in English if at all possible.

  * Nightly builds may have bugs or general instability.  If you do find any bugs, make sure to report them via [the contact page](about/contact/), or [via GitHub](https://github.com/tannerhelland/PhotoDemon/issues) if you're a developer.  Thank you!

  * If you want to know what's new since the last nightly build, please visit the official [commit log](https://github.com/tannerhelland/PhotoDemon/commits/master).

The biggest change since version 6.0 is a host of new interface options, including a dedicated TDI, or tabbed document interface, similar to a web browser.  Options are also available for floating or docking toolbars, and floating or docking windows, which should allow you to customize PhotoDemon's interface to operate like any other major photo editor.
