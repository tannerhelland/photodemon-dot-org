Over the years, many users have asked for a public forum (or discussion board) where they can ask questions, share feedback, and get help from other users.  I'm happy to announce that those requests have not been ignored: [an official PhotoDemon Forum is now available](https://github.com/tannerhelland/PhotoDemon/discussions).

PhotoDemon's new forum is hosted by GitHub, the same developer site that hosts [Apple](https://github.com/apple), [Google](https://github.com/google/), and [Microsoft's](https://github.com/microsoft/) open-source efforts (among thousands of others).  You will need [a free GitHub account](https://github.com/join) to participate.  A GitHub account allows you to participate *anywhere* on GitHub, including the open-source projects of the aforementioned companies.  

As you can imagine from the pedigree of the companies involved, GitHub's account security is best-in-class.  They provide a much safer, faster, and feature-rich discussion board template than I could develop on my own, and I'm grateful that they recently made their forum software available to open-source developers like me.  (The less time I have to spend on things like forum development, the more time I have available for PhotoDemon!)

If you have any feedback on how to improve PhotoDemon or its new public forum... [share it at the forum, of course](https://github.com/tannerhelland/PhotoDemon/discussions)!

See you there!
