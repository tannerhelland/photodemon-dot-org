Overview
--------

PhotoDemon is a free, portable, open-source photo editor for Microsoft Windows.

Its design is guided by three principles:

PhotoDemon does not require installation, administrator rights, or Internet access.  Its tiny footprint allows it to run directly from USB sticks or SD cards.

The current build provides more than 200 professional-grade tools, including layers, selection tools and digital paintbrushes, content-aware fill and resize, shadow/highlight recovery, perspective and lens correction, and full support for image files from other popular photo editors, including Adobe Photoshop (PSD), Corel Paintshop Pro (PSP), and GIMP (XCF).

<img src="media/Touch-Screen-48.png" alt="Usability" srcset="media/Touch-Screen-96.png 2x" /> **Usability**

An elegant interface built by designers - not engineers - gets out of the way and lets you work.  [Usability testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing) drives our design decisions.
