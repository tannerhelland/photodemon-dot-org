Overview
--------

PhotoDemon is a free, portable, open-source photo editor for Microsoft Windows.

Its design is guided by three principles:

PhotoDemon does not require installation, administrator rights, or Internet access.  Its tiny footprint allows it to run directly from USB devices.

The current build provides more than 200 professional-grade tools, including digital darkroom essentials like shadow/highlight recovery, multi-channel curves, content-aware resizing, and HDR.

An elegant interface built by designers - not engineers - gets out of the way and lets you work.  [Usability testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing) drives our design decisions.
