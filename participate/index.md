## Participate in PhotoDemon development

PhotoDemon would not be possible without the help of [countless awesome contributors](contributors/).  I'd love to add your name to the list.

Whether you're a developer, designer, translator, or someone with a good idea, the only requirement for participation is reading [PhotoDemon's Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/tannerhelland/PhotoDemon/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and agreeing to abide by its terms.  Once you've done that, consider yourself part of the team!

In no particular order, here are some popular ways to help.

### Donate

PhotoDemon is developed and maintained by a single individual.  Small donations mean the world to me and my family.

**[Thank you to everyone who donates](donate/).**  ❤️

### Report bugs

PhotoDemon is a huge project, and while I try my best to keep it error-free, bugs sometimes slip through the cracks.

If you encounter any issues with the program, please [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/tannerhelland/PhotoDemon/issues).

### Translate to a new language

PhotoDemon ships with a dedicated Language Editor that makes translations fast and (mostly) painless.

A detailed README file is available in the `/App/PhotoDemon/Languages` folder of every PhotoDemon download, but if you have additional questions about the translation process, please [create a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/tannerhelland/PhotoDemon/issues) so I can walk you through the process.

### Write code

PhotoDemon is written in Visual Basic 6.0.  Developers with VB6 experience can [submit pull requests directly](https://github.com/tannerhelland/PhotoDemon/pulls), while developers in other languages can submit their work by [creating a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/tannerhelland/PhotoDemon/issues).  (I can almost always translate code from other languages into something accessible to PhotoDemon - but note that PhotoDemon's requirement for portability and XP support sometimes make this challenging.)
