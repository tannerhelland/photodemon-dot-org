PhotoDemon would not be possible without the help of [countless awesome contributors](contributors/).  I'd love to add your name to the list.

Whether you're a developer, designer, translator, or someone with a good idea, the only requirement for participation is reading [PhotoDemon's Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/tannerhelland/PhotoDemon/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and agreeing to abide by its terms.  Once you've done that, consider yourself part of the team!

In no particular order, here are some of the most popular ways to help.

### Report bugs

PhotoDemon is a huge project, and while I try my best to keep it error-free, bugs sometimes slip through the cracks.

If you do encounter an issue, please [submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/tannerhelland/PhotoDemon/issues).

### Write code

PhotoDemon is written in Visual Basic 6.0.  Developers with VB6 experience can [submit pull requests directly](https://github.com/tannerhelland/PhotoDemon/pulls), while developers in other languages can submit their work by [creating a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/tannerhelland/PhotoDemon/issues).

### Translate

PhotoDemon ships with a dedicated Language Editor that makes translations fast and painless.  In fact, new translators can often complete a full translation of the program within several hours!

If you have any questions about the translation process, feel free to [create a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/tannerhelland/PhotoDemon/issues) so I can walk you through the process.

### Donate

PhotoDemon is developed and maintained by a single individual (with a family to support).  Ongoing development is primarily funded by our ongoing Patreon campaign, but we also accept one-time donations through our [donation page](donate/).  **Thank you in advance!**

*(While I canâ€™t make any promises, I do try to give extra attention to feature requests from people who donate.)*
