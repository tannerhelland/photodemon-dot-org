PhotoDemon is a portable photo editor.  It is [100% free](download/), and [100% open-source](https://github.com/tannerhelland/PhotoDemon).

The program provides a comprehensive selection of photo editing tools in a very small download.  It runs on any Windows machine (XP through Win 10), and as a portable app, you can carry it around on a USB drive or SD card.  It never needs to be installed, and it does not require administrator access to run.

PhotoDemon has been designed to work anywhere in the world, regardless of language or locale settings.  Translations are currently provided for 20+ languages.

The program is available under a permissive [BSD license](license/).  Outside contributions from coders, designers, translators, and enthusiasts [are always welcome](get-involved/).

Ongoing development is supported by [donations](donate/).  If you enjoy using the program, please consider [becoming a patron on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photodemon), or [making a one-time donation through PayPal](donate/).
