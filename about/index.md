PhotoDemon is a portable photo editor.  It is [100% free](download/) and [100% open-source](https://github.com/tannerhelland/PhotoDemon).

The app provides a comprehensive selection of photo editing tools in a very small download.  It runs on any Windows machine (XP through Windows 11), and as a portable app, you can carry it around on a USB drive or SD card.  It never needs to be installed, and it does not require administrator access to run.

PhotoDemon is designed to work anywhere in the world under any language and locale settings.  Volunteer translations are currently provided for more than a dozen languages.

The program is available under a permissive [BSD license](license/).  Outside contributions from coders, designers, translators, and enthusiasts [are always welcome](get-involved/).

Ongoing development is [supported by donations](donate/).  If you enjoy the program, please consider [a one-time donation](donate/) or [joining our Patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/photodemon).
