PhotoDemon is primarily supported by [our ongoing Patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/photodemon).  Donating through Patreon comes with extra benefits, like monthly tutorials and updates on new PhotoDemon features, and an interactive area where you can submit feature requests.  To learn more, visit PhotoDemon's Patreon page:
