Stable
-------------------

**A new stable version is almost here.**

[Version 9.0 brings many exciting improvements](2022/08/15/photodemon-9-0-beta.html), including an improved user interface, new effects and adjustments, expanded image file support, and improved performance and stability.

I expect to make 9.0 the new stable release sometime in **September 2022**, pending user feedback.  Until then, if you'd still like to download the old 8.4 release, keep reading.

For a few more days, **version 8.4 remains the latest stable release.**  [See what's new in this release](2020/09/22/photodemon-8-4.html).
